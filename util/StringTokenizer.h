    *  of the characters specified in (separators)
    *  @param tokenizeMe the string to break up into 'words'.
    *  @param hardSeparators ASCII string representing a list of characters to interpret as "hard" substring-separators.
    *                        Defaults to ","; passing in NULL is the same as passing in "" (i.e. no separators of this type).
